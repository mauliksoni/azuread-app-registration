# Azure AD App registration
Azure AD App registration for Graph Explorer to query User Info by Azure Active Directory ID

# Introduction
Microsoft Graph is the gateway to data and intelligence in Microsoft 365. It provides a unified programmability model that you can use to access the tremendous amount of data in Office 365, Windows 10, and Enterprise Mobility + Security. Use the wealth of data in Microsoft Graph to build apps for organizations and consumers that interact with millions of users.

[Users](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/users?view=graph-rest-1.0) are the representation of an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) work or school user account or a Microsoft account in Microsoft Graph. The user resource in Microsoft Graph is a hub from which you can access the relationships and resources that are relevant to your users.

Working with users in Microsoft Graph REST API requires valid token. This article will demonstrate setting up Azure AD Application and it's permissions so that it can generate token to further query graph api.
